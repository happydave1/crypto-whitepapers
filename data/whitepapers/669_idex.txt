Introduction to IDEX
IDEX is a high-performance decentralized perpetual swaps exchange. IDEX's hybrid design combines an off-chain order book, matching and liquidation engine with on-chain custody and settlement. This approach combines the speed and efficiency of traditional trading systems with the transparency and security of blockchain technology to create an unparalleled trading experience.
IDEX operates on XCHAIN, an IDEX specific Arbitrum Orbit layer 2. XCHAIN's performance support gas free and nearly instant settlement of all IDEX transactions. Positions on IDEX are collateralized by USDC bridged into XCHAIN via Stargate's Hydra protocol.
IDEX is built for all traders, providing instant execution, millisecond latency, and gas-free settlement, while allowing users to maintain full control and custody of funds.
