JPool Stake Pool Manager
Stake with Joogh: A secure and efficient Solana Pool Manager.
Hey there!
If you are reading this, you are probably interested in staking your SOL with the best possible rewards. You've come to the right place.
So why JPool?
It's simple
You don't need to analyze and compare validators, then keep monitoring those you've picked: We use a sophisticated scoring strategy in order to achieve smart, optimal distribution of SOL stake between all validator nodes participating in the pool.
Constant monitoring of all nodes enables the algorithm to proactively identify possible node performance gaps and redistribute the stake to other validators, ensuring top overall returns in every epoch.
It's transparent
We maintain full visibility of all processes, strategic decisions made by the JPool engine, and validator ranking/scoring.
You can be sure â and check for yourself â that the smart strategy works exactly the way it should.
All our fees are also absolutely transparent and listed on the 
information page
.
As of now, the epoch fee is
 5%
 of the rewards, which means the effective commission is less than 
0.3% p.a.
In case of any fee changes, we will inform you about the changes in advance, using all available channels.
It's profitable
Staking with most reliable, best-performing validators directly maximizes your returns.
It's good for the Solana network
Higher decentralization and censorship resistance makes Solana stronger â which in turn makes your SOL rise in value!
