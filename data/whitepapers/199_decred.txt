Introduction to Decred




 What is Decred?


Decred (/Ëdi:Ëkred/, /dÉªËkred/, dee-cred) is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency with a strong focus on community input, open governance, and sustainable funding for development. It utilizes a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining system to ensure that a small group cannot dominate the flow of transactions or make changes to Decred without the input of the community. A unit of the currency is called a decred (DCR).




How Does it Work?


Stakeholders make and enforce the blockchain’s consensus rules, set a course for future development, and decide how the project’s treasury is used to fund it. Decred’s blockchain is similar to Bitcoin’s, but with major aspects of 
governance
 baked into the protocol.


To align incentives, block rewards are split between Proof-of-Work (PoW) miners, stakeholders and the Decred Treasury, which funds the project.

Decred Treasury








Proof of Work
 miners play a similar role for Decred as they do for Bitcoin, but with Decred they only receive 1% of the block reward.


Proof of Stake
 voting is central to Decred’s governance. Decred holders can time-lock (or “stake”) DCR to obtain voting tickets. Tickets are randomly called to vote on-chain; this involves both approving the work of PoW miners and voting Yes/No on any open 
rule change proposals
. 89% of the block reward goes to the holders of the tickets that voted in that block.


The remaining 10% of the block reward goes into the 
Decred Treasury
. Holders of live tickets decide how that treasury is used through 
Politeia proposals and voting
.


The 
Decred Constitution
 sets out some guiding principles for the project; the constitution is subject to amendment through Politeia proposals.
