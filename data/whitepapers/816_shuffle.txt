Introduction to Shuffle.com & SHFL
Shuffle is a leading crypto casino and sports betting platform launched in February 2023. Since launch, Shuffle has grown to over 35k users and 2.8 billion bets across a suite of innovative products.
Today, Shuffle is a leading crypto casino with a world-class user experience and a reputation built on trust. We have proven that Shuffle.com is built for the modern gaming user. The Shuffle Token (SHFL) represents a huge step towards continuing to create the best crypto casino experience.
At present, casinos don't give players what they want. Players who join Shuffle refer to their former casinos as having poor user experience, mediocre bonusing or native tokens that don't directly enhance their gaming experience. 

SHFL will unlock the next wave of innovation in the casino industry and cement Shuffle as the most rewarding casino on the market.
SHFL will be tightly integrated with the core platform, reward the most active users, build the community, and take the player experience to new heights. The token is designed to grow alongside the platform, with value accrual that scales as Shuffle makes the journey to being the premier crypto casino. 
There will be several exciting utilities such as:
SHFL will be used as a wager asset 
SHFL will have a buyback-and-burn
SHFL holders can gain early access to new features, exclusive bonuses and much more

SHFL will begin its journey through distribution among the core user base of Shuffle. A total of 28% of the SHFL supply will be airdropped to the Shuffle community over the coming years, with 3 separate airdrops incentivising activity on the platform.
