Welcome to KlimaDAO
Developer guides, protocol mechanics, FAQ, and everything else you need to know to be an expert on KlimaDAO.
KlimaDAO is a public good for the planet which addresses the coordination failure that has held back the global scale-up of climate finance.
KlimaDAO and its partners in the Klima ecosystem continue to foster the adoption of a new category of real world assets (RWA) on the blockchain: environmental assets like carbon credits. 
KlimaDAO provides public goods and common-pool resources to drive an equitable, sustainable, and digitally-enabled economy.
KlimaDAO is the entry point to the environmental asset markets hosted on the blockchain.
