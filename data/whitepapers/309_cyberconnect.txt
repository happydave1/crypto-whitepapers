Deploy your first Smart Contract on Cyber L2


In this tutorial we will be learning how to deploy a simple smart contracts on Cyber L2 using 
Forge in Foundry
.


Step 1: Pre-requisites


Before deploying your smart contract, ensure you have completed the following:






Add Cyber Testnet to MetaMask


Follow the 
Guide for adding the Cyber network
 to your MetaMask wallet.






Bridging Assets to Cyber Testnet


Use the 
Bridging assets to Cyber guide
 to transfer assets from other networks to Cyber so you have funds available for deployment.






Step 2: Install Foundry






Linux or MacOS


curl
 -L
 https://foundry.paradigm.xyz
 |
 bash


foundryup






Windows


curl
 --proto
 '=https'
 --tlsv1.2
 -sSf
 https://sh.rustup.rs/
 |
 sh


cargo
 install
 --git
 https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry
 foundry-cli
 anvil
 --bins
 --locked






Step 3: Create a project


forge
 init
 hello_foundry




Foundry will create a new project directory with the name you specified. By default it will create a new project with a sample contract 
Counter
 and a sample test file.




cd
 hello_foundry




We can build the project with 
forge build




$
 forge
 build




And run the tests with 
forge test




forge
 test


Step 4: Deploying your Smart Contract


Deploying a contract with Forge is a simple process that can be done with a single command. However, it requires an RPC endpoint, a private key that has funds, and any arguments for the constructor of the contract.


To deploy the Counter.sol contract, use the command that corresponds to the Cyber chain's RPC URL while running the forge create command:


Testnet


    forge
 create
 --rpc-url
 "https://cyber-testnet.alt.technology/"
 --private-key
 YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
  src/Counter.sol:Counter


Mainnet


    forge
 create
 --rpc-url
 "https://cyber.alt.technology/"
 --private-key
 YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
 src/Counter.sol:Counter


Step 5: Verify Your Smart Contract


After deployment, you can verify your smart contract on the Cyber Explorer by visiting 
Cyber Testnet Explorer
 or 
Cyber Mainnet Explorer
.
Search for your contract using its address and confirm that it has been successfully deployed.


Congratulations on deploying your contract on our mainnet!


Step 6: Join Cyber builders ecosystem


Visit our 
Ecosystem builder form
 and fill out all required fields. Provide the transaction hash of your 
Mainnet
 contract deployment as proof and submit the form.


Step 7: Join Discord and receive NFT Airdrop




Join our 
Discord community
.




After verifying your 
Mainnet
 contract deployment and form submission, you will receive an NFT airdrop to the provided wallet address. Keep an eye on announcements in Discord for updates on the airdrop distribution process.
