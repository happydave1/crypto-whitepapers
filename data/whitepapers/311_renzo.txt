Intro
Renzo is a Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer. It is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs) and offering a higher yield than ETH staking.
The protocol abstracts all complexity from the end-user and enables easy collaboration between them and EigenLayer node operators.
Renzo strongly advocates for EigenLayer and its goal of facilitating permissionless innovation on Ethereum, and programmatically acquiring trust for the ecosystem. Renzo is built to promote the widespread adoption of Eigenlayer.
