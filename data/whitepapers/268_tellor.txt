About Tellor
Tellor is an immutable decentralized oracle protocol that incentivizes an open, permissionless network of data reporting and data validation, ensuring that data can be provided by anyone and checked by everyone.
Built for any 
data type
, our network of 
reporters
 supports your basic spot prices, more sophisticated pricing specs (TWAP/VWAP), Snapshot Vote Results, or any custom data needs you have. If your data can be verified, Tellor can 
bring it on-chain
.

Need Testnet Tokens (TRB)? 
Testnet TRB is obtained differently depending on the network youâre using.  In some cases it's only attainable by request and for others a faucet is an option.
