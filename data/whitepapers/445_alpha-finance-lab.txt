Getting Started
Stella
 is a leveraged strategies protocol with 
0% cost to borrow
. 
At Stella, borrowers (or â
leveragoors
â) can take leverage on supported DeFi strategies 
without paying any borrowing cost
. Lenders can earn real yield shared from the leveragoors as a lending APY, the more the leveragoors get, the more the lenders earn. This is made possible by Stella's 
âPay-As-You-Earnâ (PAYE) model
, designed to help leveragoors and lenders earn the highest yield potential.
Stellaâs Mission to Redefine How 'Leveraged DeFi' Works
Stella strives to become the go-to destination for leveragoors and lenders to access maximum yield potential. Whatever on-chain strategies that leveragoors want to use on leverage (and safe enough to be supported), then Stella will support at 0% cost to borrow.
