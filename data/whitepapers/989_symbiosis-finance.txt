Getting Started with Symbiosis
Welcome to the Symbiosis Documentation Center! Dive into comprehensive explanations of the principles that drive the Symbiosis protocol. Access user guides, developer tools, and much more.
Introducing Symbiosis 
Symbiosis is a decentralized exchange that pools together liquidity from different blockchains, whether they use EVM technology or not. With Symbiosis, users can effortlessly trade any token and transfer their assets across blockchains. No need to worry about which network a token is on or how to move funds between different blockchains. All cross-chain operations are done in a single click (one transaction) at competitive exchange rates and transaction costs.
The Symbiosis protocol is designed to provide a seamless cross-chain trading experience for users, while adhering to the following key principles:
Complete Decentralization
The Symbiosis protocol operates without a central authority, ensuring that no single party can halt its functionality or censor user access.
Interoperability
Symbiosis aims to connect every blockchain that attracts sufficient market interest, ultimately striving to create a unified bridge between all blockchains.
Non-custodial
User funds remain secure, as no one â not even the Symbiosis team â has access to them.
Boundless Cross-chain Liquidity
The Symbiosis protocol targets the full range of token pairs across supported blockchain networks, providing the best prices to exchange any arbitrary token pair.
What is under the Hood
Let's have a look at the parts of the Symbiosis protocol (Scheme 1).
The Symbiosis protocol consists of two main parts: 
On-chain Part: Smart Contracts
Symbiosis core smart contracts implement the on-chain logic of cross-chain operations (cross-chain swaps, cross-chain zaps, interchain communication, bridging). The smart contracts are deployed and tuned by Symbiosis administrators while adding a blockchain to the Symbiosis protocol.
Off-chain Part: Relayers Network
The Symbiosis Relayers Network is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network designed to enable fast, accurate, and secure transmission of information for cross-chain operations. As the off-chain component of the Symbiosis protocol, the network plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth and secure communication across blockchains.
Services Provided
The Symbiosis protocol provides the following services:
Cross-chain Swaps
The Symbiosis protocol was born to enable cross-chain exchange. Any token to any token cross-chain exchange is possible across supported blockchain networks.
Interchain Communicating Messenger
With Symbiosis, users can supply liquidity to other DeFi protocols. Yes, it's cross-chain and done in one transaction.
Cross-chain Zaps
Cross-chain zapping facilitates liquidity supplying to Symbiosis Octopools. Liquidity providers can supply assets via cross-chain zapping in one transaction.
Farming
Symbiosis offers several reward programs for users who provide liquidity to the Symbiosis protocol.
Symbiosis Explorer
Symbiosis Explorer collects and stores data related to cross-chain operations performed via the Symbiosis protocol.
veSIS
By staking SIS tokens, users can receive rewards, reduce cross-chain fees, increase APR for providing liquidity, and most importantly, gain voting power to shape the Symbiosis DAO.
