2023, The SMARDEX Protocol: A Novel Solution to Impermanent Loss in Decentralized Finance
Impermanent Loss (IL [1]) is a significant challenge in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space that arises when users provide tokens to a liquidity pool, and the price of those tokens changes, either upward or downward. Addressing this issue has been a major obstacle for DeFi, and all previous attempts to solve it have been unsuccessful. This paper introduces a new technology based on formulas that manage liquidity differently by using Fictive Reserve (FR). Although approaches involving FR have been attempted in the past, they did not solve the problem of IL, and in some cases, they made it worse. This scientific article details the functioning of a new Decentralised Exchange (DEX [2]) protocol implemented on SMARDEX that, for the first time, solves the problem of IL. It discusses the technical and security challenges of this protocol and explains how it opens a new door for DeFi, enabling liquidity providers to achieve Impermanent Gain (IG).
