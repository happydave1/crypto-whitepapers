What is Radworks?
In a world that almost entirely relies on software, maintaining the resilience and health of the free and open source ecosystem is more important than ever.
Radworks is building a sovereign developer stack that enables developers to securely host, collaborate, and reward open-source code. It operates as a community-governed network that uses both and off- and on-chain governance mechanisms to make decisions as a community. 
See

 for more information on our governance.
Purpose
â
Radworks focuses on funding and supporting the creation of censorship-resistant and decentralized technologies that empower builders and creators to collaborate.
Radworks is committed to transparency, inclusivity, and decentralized decision-making, ensuring that the community has a say in the direction of its efforts and the projects it supports. Together, the Radworks community can build a more decentralized and equitable future for software development.
