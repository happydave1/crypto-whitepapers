Introduction
What is Wing?
Wing has built a decentralized finance (
DeFi
) platform to support cross-chain collaborative interactions between various DeFi products. Combining the platform's decentralized governance model, the risk control mechanism introduced by Wing promotes a healthy, benign relationship between borrowers, creditors and guarantors, allowing the implementation of a wider range of DeFi plans on the platform and thus providing users with more DeFi products of premium quality. 
Wing has showcased an innovative credit valuation module as a strong support for DeFi credit products on the Wing platform.
