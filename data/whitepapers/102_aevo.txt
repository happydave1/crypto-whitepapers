Introduction
Aevo is a high-performance decentralized derivatives exchange platform, focused on options and perpetual contracts. The exchange runs on a custom EVM roll-up that rolls up to Ethereum. Aevo operates an off-chain orderbook with on-chain settlements. This means that once orders are matched, trades get executed and settled with smart contracts.
