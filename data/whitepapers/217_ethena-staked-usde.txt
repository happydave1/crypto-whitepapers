Ethena Overview
//Enabling the Internet Bond_
Ethena's USDe is 
not 
the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, backed with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions.
This means that the risks implicated by interacting with USDe are inherently different. 
Please refer to our extensive 
Risk
s
 section for more information.
Overview
Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated instrument - the 'Internet Bond'.

Ethena's synthetic dollar, 
USDe
, provides the crypto-native, scalable solution for money achieved by delta-hedging Ethereum and Bitcoin collateral. 
USDe 
is fully-backed (subject to the discussion in the Risks section regarding events potentially resulting in loss of backing) and free to compose throughout CeFi & DeFi. 
USDe 
peg stability is supported through the use of delta hedging derivatives positions against  protocol-held collateral.
The 'Internet Bond' combines yield derived from staked assets (e.g., staked Ethereum), to the extent used as backing assets, as well as the funding & basis spread from perpetual and futures markets, to create the first onchain crypto-native solution for money.
