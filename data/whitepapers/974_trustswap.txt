How we started
The SWAP token is a deflationary utility token that grants access and discounts to TrustSwap DAPPs and services including the TrustSwap Launchpad. 100,000,000 SWAP were initially minted and no more will ever exist.
TrustSwap did a private sale without vesting schedule in July 2020, where 49 individuals participated in order to receive the 
$SWAP
 utility token to obtain discounts for our EaaS (Escrow as a Service) and OTC trading smart contracts.
No other investment has been received, and no equity has been given out besides to 4 members of the C-suite team.
The full 100% of the raised amount during the ILO was used as liquidity provision on the UniSwap DEX.
60 million (60%) was sold in the ILO (initial liquidity offering) on July 9th, 2020 for $0.005 each, raising $228,845.18. 
20 million (20%) was allocated for marketing, development, legal, bounties, and airdrop campaigns. 
20 million (20%) was allotted to the team and vested at 4% per month over 25 months.
