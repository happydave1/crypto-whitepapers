Introduction


Drift Protocol is a decentralised exchange, open-sourced and built on the 
Solana blockchain
 (opens in a new tab)
.




ð Trade


Focus on the strategy, and let Drift take care of your position:




Perpetual Futures / Swaps
 - Trade the hottest perp markets with up to 10x leverage.


Spot Trading
 - Trade assets with up to 5x leverage.


Swap Tokens
 (opens in a new tab)
 - Swap any pair with up to 5x leverage.




Drift was designed with a goal to be 
capital efficient but also protective of your assets.


We achieved that by setting up sophisticated 
cross-margined risk engine
 - a system of tools with an extensive protection from over-extending risk. For instance:




In the lend/borrow markets, you can also use collateral for perpetual futures and trade more efficiently with spot assets.


Every token you deposit can earn you more through borrowing and also act as a collateral for perpetual swaps.


Borrowers can only borrow if they have more collateral than needed, following multiple safety measures for extra protection.
