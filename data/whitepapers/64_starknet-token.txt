Overview








Starknet is a permissionless Validity-Rollup, also known as a zero-knowledge rollup (ZK rollup) for Ethereum. As a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain, Starknet enables any dApp to achieve massive computation scale without compromising on Ethereumâs composability
and security.






Starknet aims to achieve secure, low-cost transactions and high performance by using the STARK cryptographic proof system. Starknet contracts and the Starknet OS are written in 
Cairo
, a custom-built and
specialized programming language.
