Interact with Kusama
Polkadot's Canary Network
â
Kusama is a 
canary network
 for Polkadot; an earlier release of the code that is available first
and holds real economic value. For developers, Kusama is a proving ground for runtime upgrades,
on-chain governance, and parachains.
No Promises
Kusama is owned by those who hold the Kusama tokens (KSM). There's no central kill switch and all
changes are made through the protocol's on-chain governance.
The network is a permissionless and anyone can come along and start using it. Those who participated
in the Polkadot sale can claim a proportional amount of KSM through the

Kusama Claims process
.
Kusama is experimental. 
Expect Chaos
.
As a KSM holder
You can interact with all the features of the Kusama network such as staking (i.e. validating or
nominating), governance, parachain auctions, basic transfers and everything else.

What can I do with my KSM?
