Decentralized IP Governance
pixelmon IP Governance
One of MON Protocolâs functions is to enable on-chain IP governance. The first use case of MONâs governance model will be that of governing the fractionalized IP of Pixelmonâs 200+ monster characters.
MON DAO will enable a series of features:
These features constitute a decentralized incentive system aimed at growing any MON Protocol partner IP across multiple projects and verticals.
The governance system will transition from the MON Foundation into a DAO structure only at a later stage in the future, and it will not be available at or immediately after the token launch.
