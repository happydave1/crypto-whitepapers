Telos Evolved 02: Unveiling the Roadmap
We've laid out a visionary and cutting-edge roadmap for Telos in 2024. Central to this plan is the management of high-volume transactions enhanced by zero knowledge proofs and the introduction of our Scalable Proof Protocol. These steps are crucial in leading the charge for widespread blockchain adoption, focusing on scalability and protecting user data. Upgrading the tEVM and innovating with a blockchain-as-a-service model will further these objectives. Additionally, the Tekika NFT collection and the Telos ZK EVM Gaming Chain, K2-18, spotlight our strategic commitment to community engagement and exploring the web3 gaming market. These collective efforts are a significant milestone in Telos' journey, merging technological advancements with practical gaming applications and beyond.
