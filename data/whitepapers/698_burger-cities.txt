BurgerCities
BurgerCities is a one-stop MetaFi platform with a wide range of features, including its native token BURGER, a Decentralized Exchange (DEX), and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) which are made up of Heroes, Props, and Lands. Users can participate in daily activities like socializing, and playing games, as well as experience DeFi and NFT features with their own avatars like trading, staking, NFT exhibitions, etc.
BurgerCities âevolvedâ from Burgerswap, a DeFi product that was already available on BNB Chain. It integrates DeFi and NFT into a larger metaverse scene to produce a uniform and standardized Web3 metaverse.
BurgerCities aims to create a unified and standardized metaverse world of Web3 via integrating DeFi, NFT to the wider Metaverse. In this world, users could carry out daily events such as sociality, gaming, etc. Meanwhile, they could experience DeFi and NFT functions with their own avatars such as trade, bet, NFT exhibitions or Gamefi, etc.
BurgerCities hopes to contribute fresh energy to the vigorous development of the metaverse and bring new vitality to Web3 applications such as DeFi and NFT.
