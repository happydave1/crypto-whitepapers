Welcome to ArchLoot
A UGC NFT Game on BNB Chain with loot-style composability and playability
Launched in 2022, ArchLoot is a UGC (user-generated content) NFT game with loot-style composability and playability. Built on BNB Chain, it provides the first interactive gameplay in the industry, which fully enables on-chain implementation of upgradeable characters/props NFTs and unleashes its potential for playability and user-generated content robustness. The game intends to build an ecosystem, including a great game and a creative community, that truly achieves a balance between playability, accessibility, and profitability.
Gathering talents from the world's leading gaming publisher, blockchain projects, and financial elites, the team now has 40 experienced members and is currently operating across continents. The project has been expanding its network of investors and collaborations, including Binance NFT, FBG Capital, Alphabet, and YGG SEA to keep fully funded operations and deliver milestone objectives.
