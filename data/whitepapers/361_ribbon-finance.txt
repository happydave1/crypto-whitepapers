Introduction to Ribbon Finance
Ribbon Finance
 is a suite of DeFi protocols that help users access crypto structured products. By combining derivatives, lending and a proprietary 
on-chain options exchange (Aevo)
, Ribbon aims to be the one-stop solution for users who want to improve a portfolio's risk-return profile.
Here you can find the products descriptions and 
outgoing links

Theta Vaults (DOVs)
Theta Vaults, also known as DOVs (DeFi Options Vaults), were invented by Ribbon in 2021. At its core, a Theta vault is a yield-oriented strategy that proposes that depositors trade volatility on their underlying by selling 
European options
 with weekly expiration. The sale value of these options, or "premium," is set through 
auctions
 and determines the vault return. The vault reinvests the premiums earned back into the strategy, effectively compounding them for depositors over time.
There are two types currently active:
Covered call selling
: each week the vault issues 
OTM (out of the money)
 call options on all deposits.
Put selling
: each week the vault issues OTM put options on all deposits.

Ribbon Earn
The 
R-Earn vaults
 employ fully funded strategies to capitalize on the intra-week ETH movements, while also ensuring their capital is protected. The vaults earns a base APY and uses the remaining funding to purchase weekly options.
There are currently two vaults available:
Earn USDC: it employs a twin win strategy through which depositors can capitalise on the intra-week ETH movements in either direction;
Earn stETH: employs dolphin strategy through which depositors can capitalise on the upside ETH movements.

Ribbon Treasury
Ribbon Treasury are private Ribbon Theta vaults built specifically for DAOs to run covered calls on their native tokens. These private vaults are segregated from the main Ribbon vaults, and run a custom strategy for each DAO. Each vault has a few unique parameters:
Strike Selection Methodology

DAOs can choose how aggressive they want to be with regards to the strike selection methodology. 
Tenor

DAOs can choose how often they want to run the strategy. The current Ribbon Vaults run a weekly strategy that automatically re-rolls, but DAOs can choose longer tenors.
Premium Currency

DAOs can also choose what currency they want to receive the premiums in. For example, a DAO could elect to receive premiums in USDC or ETH, depending on their treasury diversification goals.

Ribbon Lend
***Ribbon Lend is currently paused until further notice***

High yields from unsecured lending
No lockups from Aaveâs money market model
Off-chain enforcement / credit underwriting
