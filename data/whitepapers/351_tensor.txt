Welcome
Tensor Foundation facilitates community-led governance over Tensor protocols and helps the Tensor DAO grow and develop the Tensor ecosystem.
Tensor protocols are critical trading infrastructure for NFTs built on Solana â one of the only chains with the throughput, speed, and low fees necessary for mass adoption.
To date, Tensor protocols have traded over $2bn worth of Solana NFTs. In the past 90 days they have facilitated over 
70% of Solanaâs NFT trading volume
 (wash trading removed).
