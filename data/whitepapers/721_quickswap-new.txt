What is Quickswap?
Overview
QuickSwap is the leading DEX with deployments on:
Polygon PoS
Polygon zkEVM
Dogechain
Manta Pacific
Immutable zkEVM
Astar zkEVM
X Layer
Users can swap, LP, farm, stake, and trade perpetual swaps at fast speeds with extremely low transaction fees. Home to the DragonFi ecosystem, QuickSwap aims to provide a comprehensive suite of products and services that extend beyond just DeFi, including a decentralised Perpetual Exchange, Gaming Hub, and more.
Origins
QuickSwap was created to solve the high gas fees & slow transaction times associated with using DEXs (decentralised exchanges) on other networks such as Ethereum.
Launching in October 2021, QuickSwap is supported by some of the industryâs most prominent thought leaders in the fields of Ethereum token & contract standards and Layer 2 scaling. It was kickstarted by a team of professionals who are experts in blockchain:
Nick Mudge is an Ethereum contract programmer, code reviewer, security auditor, standards author, and web developer with over 6 years of active blockchain programming experience. Nick participated in the discussions that developed the ERC721 standard and is the author of 
EIP-2535 Diamond Standard
, in addition to 
ERC1538
 and 
ERC998
 Ethereum contract standards
