Welcome to Solchat
Solchat - Solana Communication Protocol
Solana is currently a leading blockchain with lower gas fees. Therefore, we have introduced a communication protocol on Solana called Solchat. Users can text, voice call, video call, and do many other things similar to Web2, but in a Web3 environment. Solchat (beta v1) leverages the power of Solana, ensuring all messages and group chats are stored on-chain. Audio and video calls are facilitated peer-to-peer via WebRTC, eliminating the need for a database and preventing leaks. Privacy is our top priority, with every interaction encrypted.
