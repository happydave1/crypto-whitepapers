Accelerating scientific research
The scientific record is too important to be hidden behind paywalls and in ivory towers. Science should be open: not only for reading, but also for reusing. 
ResearchHub, and by extension ResearchCoin, are designed to accelerate the pace of scientific research by encouraging academics to interact in a fully open and collaborative manner. 
These docs will describe the ResearchHub network, ResearchCoin, the impetus for the creation of both, and the intended impact on the scientific community.
