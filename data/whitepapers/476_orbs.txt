Fully Distributed Group Signatures
Published April 2019
A group signature scheme is a powerful primitive by which one can sign a message as a member of a well-defined group without leaking oneâs individual identity, but the group manager can revoke this anonymity and reveal the identity of the signer. We present two highly efficient fully distributed group signature schemes in this paper.

Rational Threshold Cryptosystems
Published January 2019
We propose a framework for threshold cryptosystems under a permissionless-economic model in which the participants are rational profit-maximizing entities. The key threat to rational threshold cryptosystems is collusionâby cooperating `illegallyâ, a subset of participants can reveal the cryptosystemâs secret, which, in turn is translated to unfair profit. Our countermeasure to collusion is framing.

Arbidex integrates dLIMIT & dTWAP powered by Orbs


Shawn O'Donaghue
|
6 months ago
Arbidex, one of the largest DEXs on Arbitrum, has integrated the 
dLimit
 & 
dTWAP protocol
 powered by Orbs!
As a result, Arbidex traders will now have access to both advanced order types, enabling traders to guarantee the price of their orders or break up large orders into smaller trades. This development follows successful integrations with other prominent DEXs including QuickSwap, SpookySwap, Thena, and more. With each integration, dLIMIT and dTWAP further solidify Orbs' position as a market leader in DeFi innovation, showcasing Orbs' novel 
layer 3 technology
 for pushing the boundaries of smart contract technology.
dLIMIT and dTWAP are fully decentralized, permissionless, and composable DeFi protocols developed by the Orbs project and powered by the Orbs network. ArbiDex traders will now have access to the advanced order types at no extra cost, with dLimit enabling limit orders for single transactions and dTWAP enabling the execution of commonly used algorithmic trading strategies, all in a decentralized manner that was not available before.
Orbs
 is a decentralized protocol executed by a public network of permissionless validators using PoS, staked with TVL valued at over a hundred million dollars. Orbs pioneers the concept of L3 infrastructure, by utilizing the Orbs decentralized network to enhance the capabilities of existing EVM smart contracts, opening up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi.
Trade DeFi like a Pro


In the past month, ArbiDex supported a transaction volume of over 7 million dollars at the time of writing. dLIMIT & dTWAP will expand the DEX's current offerings, potentially opening up another avenue for the project to increase trading volumes.
For those who are unfamiliar, a Limit order allows users to buy or sell tokens at a specific price or better. While the specified price is guaranteed, the execution of the order is not and depends on price movement. Limit orders will only be executed if the market price meets the order specifications.
In contrast, a TWAP order is an algorithmic trading strategy that aims to reduce the impact of large orders on the market by breaking them down into smaller portions that are then executed over time. By executing smaller orders, this approach lessens the price impact or enables traders to gradually acquire various assets over a specific period. In DeFi this is particularly useful as pools need time to rebalance.
ArbiDex's traders can now utilize both of these key traditional finance orders without sacrificing decentralization.
Setting up a dLIMIT and dTWAP orders


When switching to a dLIMIT 'swap' on ArbiDex, users are presented with an easy-to-follow user interface alongside an order history tab to keep track of previous transactions.
Before executing a dLIMIT order, traders must specify the following:


From: The token that they currently have


To: The token that they wish to swap for


Limit price: Trades will ONLY be executed when the available market price is equal to or better than the Limit price.




dLIMIT takes into account current market conditions, prices, and gas fees. Once the parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and review their order live in the 'order history' tab.
For a dTWAP order, three additional parameters need to be specified:


No. of Intervals: allows the user to specify the number of individual trades. The UI automatically calculates the total number of transactions required to complete the entire order and the estimated trading interval.


Max Duration: the maximum time during which the total amount of individual trades making up the full dTWAP order may be executed.


Trade Interval: sets the time gap between each individual trade. The user can edit this parameter, which also results in changes to the corresponding trade size and number parameters.




Similarly to dLIMIT, these parameters provide incredible flexibility in customizing each order, taking into account factors like market conditions and current gas fees. Additionally, the UI facilitates both dTWAP-market orders, which execute all trades at the available market price, and dTWAP-Limit orders, which only execute individual trades if they are within the price Limit set by the user. Once these parameters are set, the user can approve the specific source token, place the order, and confirm their specified configuration.
Redefining Trading Standards on Decentralized Exchanges
The dLIMIT & dTWAP protocols, powered by 
Orbs L3 technology
, have become the industry standard for decentralized algorithmic orders in DeFi.
To date, the protocol has been implemented by 8 prominent DEXs spanning 5 chains, facilitating over 5 million dollars in trading volume.

7 months ago
Orbs has received increased attention from the broader web3 ecosystem in October and has seen a significant rise in participation. Among other things, the ORBS token has been listed on over 20 exchanges, including venues like Binance and Bybit. This has helped the community grow. As the Orbs community has grown, so has interest in participating in staking. The Orbs project is decentralized and community-based, valuing community and core web3 values. Â  One way to solidify the long-term engagement of new community members is to encourage them to take an active part in the work of securing and operating the Orbs Network's technology by participating in the Orbs Proof-of-Stake Universe. To welcome and encourage new community members to participate, the Orbs community approved a governance vote to introduce the Orbs triple APY event for new stake.
Event details


All NEW Orbs tokens staked in November and December 2023 will receive additional rewards.
â° Event period: ~ 31th Dec 2023Â 
ð Additional APY
Triple: All new Orbs tokens staked during November 2023, will get triple rewards during the promotion
Double: All new Orbs tokens staked in December 2023 will get double rewards during the promotion 
ð Network: Ethereum and Polygon
â  How to participate: Staking using the 
Tetra Staking Wallet
Example


Alice stakes 5M Orbs before November 1st and then added 2M Orbs on Nov 15th, and added another 1M Orbs on 3rd Dec.
The 5M Orbs Alice staked before the event (November 1st), is not eligible.
For the 2M Orbs staked on Nov 15th, Alice will get triple APY during 1st ~ 30th Nov.
For the 1M Orbs staked on 3rd Dec, Alice gets double APY during 1st ~ 31th Dec
Things to note


Only Orbs additional staked during Nov and Dec 23 are eligibleÂ
