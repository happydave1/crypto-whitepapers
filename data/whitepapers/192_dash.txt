Dash Documentation
#


Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused
cryptocurrency in the world. The Dash network features 
instant
transaction confirmation
, double spend protection,
optional 
privacy
 equal to that of physical cash, a

self-governing, self-funding model

driven by 
incentivized full nodes
 and a

clear roadmap
 for on-chain scaling to
up to 400MB blocks using custom-developed open source hardware. While
Dash is based on Bitcoin and compatible with many key components of the
Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-tier network structure offers significant
improvements in transaction speed, privacy and governance. This section
of the documentation describes these and many more key features that set
Dash apart in the blockchain economy.


Check out the 
official Dash website
 to learn
how 
individuals
 and 
businesses

how to buy Dash
 and

safety
