Purpose
The Akita DAO exists to produce products and useful applications that benefit holders of the AKITA tokens. AKITA token holders were the original group to come together and make AKITA a true community-owned token, pushing it to be more than just a meme. The Akita DAO allows its participants to propose new improvements, and 
vote
 in our governance system using the 
HACHI token
 to steer the decision-making process.
