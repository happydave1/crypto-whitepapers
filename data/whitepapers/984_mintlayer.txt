    Introduction 
#




Mintlayer is a long-term, secure solution for scaling and accelerating the future of decentralized finance.


Today, 
sustainability
 is rarely considered when designing blockchain technology. Consequently, we are presented with a problem where many existing and dominating networks face a cluster of issues. 
Blockchains get clogged
, causing a spike in transaction 
fees
, and their users face high 
barriers of running a node
. This 
sacrifices
 the core feature of the blockchain technology: 
decentralization
.


Currently, the DeFi ecosystem runs on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, where nodes can only be managed by 
specialized servers rather than average users
. This policy achieves nothing in terms of the chainâs usability: fees are skyrocketing and most users are left outside of the blockchainâs governing decisions. These conditions pose 
security threats for daily users
 that mostly rely on light nodes or custodians, and lead to more 
centralized project choices
. Several examples, such as rollbacks and fork upgrades, end up being discussed within a very tiny niche of users, primarily miners or the most influential public figures.


The 
lack
 of future-proof sustainability and 
long-term plans for scalability
, combined with a complex technical architecture, make Ethereum an unsuitable long-term solution for truly decentralized finance. The clogged network cannot guarantee 
proper functionality of DEXs
 without off-chain layer solutions such as the Lightning Network, while gigantic nodes have increasingly slow syncing time. Moreover, the built-in Turing-completeness, which is part of the protocol, causes users and investors to encounter risks while interacting with 
smart contracts
.


Mintlayer is creating the very first sustainable architecture for decentralized finance, inheriting its security model from Bitcoin.


Next: Blockchain architecture
