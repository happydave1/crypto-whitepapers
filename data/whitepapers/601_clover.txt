CLV - Passport to the Omniverse
CLV is a one-stop infrastructure platform for cross-chain and decentralized applications. The CLV chain is a Substrate-based specialized Layer-1 chain that is EVM compatible, cross-chain interoperable, and also functions as a Parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem. Infrastructure made ready for scaling dApp in the multi-chain universe. CLV wallet is a cross-chain all-in-one wallet, for Day-to-Day, DeFi, Metaverse and Gaming purposes. With multi-dimensional products lineup, including CLV Multi-Chain Wallets, CLV dApp Interaction Protocol, CLV Chain EVM and Universal Cross-Chain Support, CLV uniquely positioned itself as âPassport to the Omniverse.â
Built on Substrate
Substrate is technically fit for CLV. By building on top of Substrate, CLV is able to leverage the extensive functionalities that Substrate provides out-of-the-box, rather than needing to build them from scratch. These functionalities include peer-to-peer networking, consensus mechanisms, governance functionality, EVM implementation, and more. Overall, using Substrate will dramatically reduce the time and work needed to implement CLV. Substrate allows a great degree of customization, which is compulsory when achieving compatibility with Ethereum. Meanwhile, by adopting Rust, CLV will gain both safety guarantee and performance enhancement.
CLV History 
CLV's journey started in May 2020, where it saw the emerging need for blockchains' interoperability and compatibility. 
In Feb of 2021, after months of development, CLV was listed as one of the CoinList Seed Winter 2021 alumni, and later successfully held the initial token offering event on CoinList in April 2021. 
Since the token generation event, CLV's native token $CLV has quickly been made available to trade on all major exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Huobi, OKX, KuCoin, Bithumb Global, Gate.io, MEXC and so on by July 2021. 
In addition to the existing wallet platforms line-up that was introduced back in May, CLV launched an all-new Web Wallet in October 2021. This enables social login and brings easy-of-use for crypto wallet to a new level.
By November 2021, CLV wallet apps have achieved 350k cumulative downloads from all platforms.
Winning the 5th Parachain slot on Polkadot in December 2021 enables CLV to be one of the first to bring full-suite decentralized applications to the Polkadot ecosystem.
