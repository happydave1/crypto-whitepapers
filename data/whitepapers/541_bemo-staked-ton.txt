Introduction
What is bemo?
bemo
 is a non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on The Open Network (TON) blockchain. It is the first liquid staking application on TON that allows you to stake native TON tokens and, in return, get stTON tokens which you can use freely in DeFi.
The price of the stTON token to TON increases with the staking rewards accrued after each validation round by 
bemo
 protocol.
