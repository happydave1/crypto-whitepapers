Chainlink 2.0 and the future of Decentralized Oracle Networks
This whitepaper expands the role of Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) in the blockchain ecosystem, laying out the key advancements for the Chainlink Network to power a suite of decentralized services for smart contracts on any blockchain.
Download whitepaper
Technical advancements
To empower a broad range of next-generation smart contract applications and use cases, Chainlink 2.0 focuses on oracle technology advances in seven key areas.
Hybrid smart contracts
Augment the capabilities of smart contracts by securely composing on-chain and off-chain computing resources into hybrid smart contracts.
Read more
Scaling
Ensure decentralized oracle networks achieve the latencies and throughputs required by high-performance blockchains, layer-2 solutions, and Web2 systems.
Read more
Abstracting away complexity
Present developers and users with simple functionality that eliminates the need for familiarity with complex underlying protocols and system boundaries.
Read more
Confidentiality
Catalyze high integrity systems that combine blockchainsâ innate transparency with strong confidentiality protections for sensitive data and computations.
Read more
Order fairness
Support transaction sequencing in ways that are fair for end-users and prevent front-running and other forms of value extraction by bots and exploitative miners.
Read more
Trust-minimization
Create a reliable layer of support for smart contracts and other oracle-dependent systems by means of decentralization, cryptographic guarantees, and guardrails.
Read more
Cryptoeconomic security
Ensure nodes in decentralized oracle networks have strong economic incentives to behave reliably and correctly, even in the face of well-resourced adversaries.
