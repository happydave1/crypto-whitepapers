Ontology
 is a next-gen network of public blockchains, and a distributed, trust-based collaboration platform with integrated support for ledger accounts and smart contracts.
Apart from providing support for the services and applications running on its public chains, Ontology also supports the public chains of the applications that have been developed on it's framework, and collaboration with various protocol groups.
On a more fundamental level, Ontology continues to provide a wide range of universal modules, such as the 
Distributed Identity Framework (DID)
, the distributed 
Distributed Data Exchange Framework (DDXF)
, and other such distributed trust collaboration packages and modules.
This 
documentation center
 serves as a guide for developers that are just getting started with 
dApp
 development with Ontology, apart from providing information on the different components of the Ontology framework.
It also serves as a location to explore and understand all the different resources available that can assist developers with their application development process.
Any issues or inaccuracies related to documentation can be shared with us by following
