Official documentation and Lite-Paper of Pixels.xyz
Pixels is a captivating, open-ended world of farming and exploration, built one pixel at a time. Gathering resources, advancing skills, and building relationships while exploring the story and quests woven throughout the Pixels Universe, youâll be submerged in a mesmerizing blend of managing, creating, and exploring in a world that marries blockchain ownership with your progression and accomplishments.
We aim to create a fun, easy-going, blockchain-backed game. We believe that Pixels will be the gateway for millions into web3.
Mission
Behind every successful web3 game is a thriving, engaged, and passionate community. We started with a core, devoted community that has only expanded as Pixels has been shared with friends, families, and other communities. Community is the heart of Pixels.
As we move into the next stages, Pixels aims to push the boundaries of web3 gaming by experimenting and iterating on the core primitives of web3.

We aim to experiment, build, and iterate on the features that make web3 gaming unique.
Some areas of interest to us are...
Play-to-earn
Guilds
On-chain Reputation & Player Personas
Social-Fi
Interoperability
We believe there are still more interesting features yet to be uncovered in web3 that will power the next generation of gaming. We aim to help the space uncover more.
