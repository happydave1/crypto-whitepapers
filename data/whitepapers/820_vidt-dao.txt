$VIDT Utility Token








The cornerstone of VIDT DAO.

Binance Tag








$VIDT has recently been awarded the Layer 1 / Layer 2 tag on Binance, meaning  it has shown that it is capable of either supporting the base layer of a blockchain network (Layer 1) or enhancing its functionality and performance through a secondary protocol or framework (Layer 2).
In the case of VIDT, receiving this tag suggests that Binance recognizes the token's role in both these layers, indicating the project's contribution to the blockchain ecosystem.
