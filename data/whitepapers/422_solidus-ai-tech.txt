Introduction to AITECH
Solidus has successfully constructed an environmentally conscious, state-of-the-art High-Performance Computing (HPC) Data Centre spanning over 8,000 square feet. This facility is strategically situated in a highly secure European location. In conjunction with this remarkable achievement, Solidus is set to unveil the world's pioneering deflationary AI infrastructure utility token, known as AITECH. This token will serve as a payment gateway for accessing services of the Artificial intelligence & GPU Marketplace.
AITECH, as the core token fueling the Solidus AI Tech ecosystem, presents a comprehensive solution for procuring all services available on the platform. In addition to facilitating token payments, Solidus offers the convenience of accepting traditional payment methods. The conversion of fiat currency transactions to AITECH occurs seamlessly on the backend, with the entire process conducted on the Blockchain utilizing AITECH tokens. 
As an integral component of our deflationary token economy, a percentage (yet to be determined) of AITECH tokens utilized for acquiring services on the platform will be systematically burned. This meticulous process ensures the utmost transparency, as the precise number of tokens subjected to burning can be readily monitored through our comprehensive dashboard.
Dive to the Past
When Solidus launched in December 2017 as a Ethereum Mining entity, the company has an intimation that Ethereum would very likely move from âproof of workâ to âproof of stakeâ and would no longer be mineable largely due to the aforementioned pending updates and developments in the Ethereum roadmap. Furthermore, the EIP-1559 upgrade will eventually make Ethereum deflationary. The Solidus team knew that this scenario was probable, and pre-emptively opened up channels of communication with our joint venture partner's international clients, these include of Governmental Authorities and Corporations who would likely require AI & HPC services in the future.
When the data centre and AI & GPU marketplace is complete, Solidus Ai Tech will begin generating revenue from Governmental Authorities, Corporations, SMEs & Web3 & Blockchain companies. The long-term plan is to scale up by building additional data centres across the globe. All of our data centres will follow our unique protocol.
