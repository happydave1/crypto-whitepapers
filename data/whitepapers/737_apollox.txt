V1 Order Book Perp (BNB Chain, Ethereum, Arbitrum, zkSync, Base, Manta)
Adopting an "off-chain transaction matching + on-chain fund settlement and custody" model, APX V1 Order Book Perp achieves high transaction performance and fast response speeds while ensuring the safety of usersâ funds. Trade over 95 markets with up to 250x leverage and enjoy competitive fees of 0.02% maker, 0.07% taker.
Users connect their decentralized wallets to the exchange before signing and verifying the connection through a Web3 interface. They can then transfer (ERC-20/BEP-20) tokens into the smart contract for fund custody and settlement. Once the off-chain ledger is recorded, users can use the funds to trade derivatives off-chain and the PnL will be accounted for in the ledger. After settlement, users can withdraw the funds by calling the smart contract (except for the margin occupied by open positions and pending orders).
