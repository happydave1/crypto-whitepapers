MARBLEX
OVERVIEW
MARBLEX is a blockchain game ecosystem that is built around exceptional games. Originating from the top 10 global game publishers, Netmarble Corporation, MARBLEX was established with the goal of building a blockchain ecosystem specialized for games and enhancing and creating a sustainable structure for a business model suited for game publishing.

A blockchain game ecosystem specialized for games refers to the structure where all ecosystem membersâincluding developers, service providers, publishers, and users alikeâcould each earn their respective profits or benefits.
In order to help all ecosystem members participate in activities and utilize its infrastructure freely and seamlessly, MARBLEX created an ecosystem that is comprised of multidimensional services and continues to explore ways to enhance token utility.
