What is Enzyme?
Safeguard operations and streamline the management of digital assets
Enzyme is an easy-to-use on-chain asset management system that enables access to digital assets and DeFi from one simple, unified app. It provides a front-to-back execution and order management system, which provides fully automated reporting, risk management, administration, governance and operations.
