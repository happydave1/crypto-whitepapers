League of Kingdoms
The first MMO Strategy game on blockchain
This whitepaper will provide information about the past, present, and future of a blockchain Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) strategy game, League of Kingdoms.
League of Kingdoms has launched in July 2020 as the first 4x MMO strategy game on the blockchain. The game is currently as of Q1 2022 one of the fastest-growing blockchain MMO games in the world. 
The game runs on the blockchain network and its NFT ecosystem involves various in-game assets and properties including its iconic Land NFT.  The Land NFTs are stored on the blockchain network and represent the very ground where the League of Kingdoms world stands. 
Not only gamers can own these Lands, but also gather resources on the Lands and mint them into NFTs to trade. All these tokenized assets are transparently and trustlessly transacted and traded across the blockchain, without intermediaries. 
The game offers various gameplay modes, ranging from PvE to MMO. In the future, more game modes, events, quests, campaigns, and competitions will be added to the game universe.
With the entire gamut of diverse and engaging content, there is no time to be bored in the world of League of Kingdoms!ð¥ð¥

We envision that our continuous efforts to shape how gamers relate their game experience with their real-life will expand what gamers can do in the digital sphere, further erasing the boundaries between peopleâs online and physical lives.
