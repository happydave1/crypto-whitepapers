Introduction
Synternet is a blockchain that powers modular, interoperable data infrastructure across all major chains. At its core lies the Data Layer, a protocol serving as the customizable execution layer between all blockchains. Designed for efficiency, security, and interoperability, the Data Layer enables a fully decentralized data exchange for developers, organizations, and users. By eliminating dependence on centralized services, Synternet provides swift and seamless access to both real-time and historical on-chain data. Synternet's modular data infrastructure fosters a dynamic ecosystem committed to powering the next generation of decentralized applications while unlocking unprecedented opportunities for innovation.
