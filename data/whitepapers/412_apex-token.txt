ApeX Pro
ApeX Pro is a non-custodial trading platform that delivers limitless cross-margined perpetual contracts to its metacommunity under a new social trading framework. 
It is primed to deliver limitless access to the perpetual swaps market with its order book model, as it remains committed to the promises of not just speed and efficiency, but also security with transparency on traders' assets.
With the integration of StarkWare's Layer 2 scalability engine StarkEx and Validium, ApeX Pro offers cross-margined perpetual contracts with multi-chain support, low fees, deep liquidity and maximum security. 
Why StarkExï¼
StarkEx is a Layer 2 scalability engine developed by StarkWare powered by STARK-proofs, a form of zero-knowledge proof. Leveraging StarkEx's use of cryptographic proofs in validating transactions and also Validium, ApeX Pro is poised to provide faster transaction processing speeds and some of the lowest gas fees across the DeFi sphere. Engineered for higher liquidity and greater network interoperability, users can access non-custodial trading on ETH, and ERC-20 and EVM-compatible tokens.
Why Order Book?
ApeX Pro offers an optimal combination of security and transparency one would usually see in a decentralized exchange (DEX), and the speed and usability users are used to seeing on centralized exchanges (CEXs).
 
The order book model helps bridge the gap between users who are used to utilizing order books with their trades, but now on a permissionless trading platform.
Core Value Propositions
Maximum Security
On-chain data availability and integrity can be ensured with StarkWare's STARK proofs, a form of ZK rollup technology that will help safeguard a fully non-custodial protocol. Built on the Ethereum network, this Layer 2 architecture publishes zero-knowledge proofs directly to Ethereum smart contracts for verification. Transactions are also uniquely packaged for publishing on-chain for traders concerned about data privacy as only balance charges will be made visible.
Preserving Privacy
The underlying, upgraded protocol will increase ApeX Pro's trade settlement capacity, while fortifying the secure validations of every transaction on the trading platform, all without compromising the privacy of a trader with respect to their personal transaction data and activities.
Lower Fees, Greater Leverage & Instant Settlement
Amplified earnings are now possible as trades can be executed at up to 50x leverage, at the lowest costs with lesser starting capital and optimized trade sizes. Trading on ApeX Pro feels every bit as fast as trading on a centralized exchange.
Multi-Chain Support
Open to ETH, ERC-20 tokens and also tokens from EVM-compatible chains; cross-chain deposits and withdrawals are supported on ApeX Pro.
