CEO statement








Dear Stakeholders, Employees, Customers and Friends


 


AXEL is founded on the basic principal that your personal and private data is yours and yours alone.  Nobody should have control over content you own, create, manage and share.


 


To that end, we have built a global decentralized network as the framework to provide the superhighway for next generation digital content management. Powered by Blockchain, Masternode and AXEL's own patented technologies, our goal is to deliver a global environment to safely and securely manage digital content for both consumer and enterprise interests.


 


As we continue down the path of providing best-in-class privacy and security tools to enable storage, sharing and transfer of digital content, we invite you to join us by adding your technology and applications to our continuously expanding ecommerce network.


 


AXEL is committed to continued growth and expansion of the AXEL Network as we move forward forging partnerships with other technology developers and providers to expand the capabilities of the AXEL Network.


 


 


Sincerely,


 


Tony Tan


CEO and Chairman
























Introduction








Data is the new gold. Itâs the new oil. Itâs the new currency. In the digital economy, data has become one of the greatest drivers of value. The largest companies in the world are powered by data - Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent...the list continues.


 


But the creators of data have seen their control over their own identities eroded. Sometimes openly, often covertly. Even big companies have been left vulnerable to a lack of transparency on how data is managed by other companies.


 


Choice and control are compromised for convenience. And many individuals and companies are left to believe that you can only have one or the other.


 


AXEL has different ideas. We believe control should always remain with the data creator and weâre creating the tools to enable everyone to participate in the digital economy. We call it âdata custodyâ. In fact, weâre redefining how data is handled


 


Data Custody, n. v. adj.


 


1. The ability to organize, manage and protect your own digital data and footprint on centralized and






decentralized networks;


 


2. The ability to protect and guard your own data without interruption, interference, or intrusion from third parties or network operators;


 


3. The act of taking back control of your personal data in order to guard and protect it from others.


 


AXEL (Autonomous eXchange via Entrusted Ledger) has and continues to set the precedent for data custody by developing the tools and technologies to return control of data to our users. To this end, each of AXELâs 100+ employees are dedicated to building the technologies necessary to provide ultimate data custody to our millions of users.


 


With deep roots in building solutions to give users and businesses data custody, AXEL is introducing the AXEL Global Distributed Network (AGDN). The AGDN will be one of, if not the, largest decentralized networks in the world. It will be developed on blockchain and distributed technology along with a range of new distributed products for users to easily interact with the network. AXEL is building the future of data. A future that returns data custody to the data creator.


























Tackling Data Custody










The Problem: Centralized Data Custody is Broken


 


Control, privacy, and trust do not exist for the majority of people in the digital economy. Ownership has been outsourced to third parties - and they hold all the keys. Data is breached, data is sold, data is unwittingly collected. Those who create the data have lost control.


 


The $60 billion big data business powers the $6 trillion digital economy that mirrored the growth of the internet when the earliest version of cookies was introduced in 1994.


 


The internet spawned a data revolution that led to systemized concentration and control of user data by major platforms that we believe significantly handicap the development of user-first platforms, erode privacy, and create an imbalance of influence.


 


This environment creates huge barriers in building genuine peer-to-peer systems that allow people to be in control of their identity and instead have commoditized it. With e-commerce, the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and wearables joining mobile technology at the heart of the digital world, more data collection is concentrated with a few players that place user privacy and data integrity as a low priority.


 


As new technologies, such as distributed computing, emerge as competition to centralized technologies, new questions surrounding data custody arise. Decentralized and distributed networks have many performance and






cost-savings benefits; however, new tools and  technologies must be created to secure and manage personal and business data on vast decentralized networks. These tools and technologies must be created by trusted names with experience and a record of protecting users from the intrusion of third parties.


 


In 2020, over 30 billion records were exposed from nearly 3,000 publicly reported data breaches. These figures are expected to continue to grow exponentially in 2021 and is leading to an erosion of trust in providers who possess sensitive information.


 


The following is a list of high-profile data breaches in 2020, and these are just the ones we know about. Far too often data breaches go unreported for many months or are never reported at all.


 


MGM â 142 million records


Google Cloud â 201 million records


Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube â 235 million records


Microsoft â 250 million records


Facebook â 267 million records


Wattpad â 268 million records


Broadvoice â 350 million records


Estee Lauder â 440 million records


Sina Weibo â 538 million records


Whisper â 900 million records


Keepnet labs â 5 billion Records


Advanced Info Service â 8.3 billion records


CAM4 â 10.88 billion records


SolarWinds â 18,000 organizations and countless records


























The AXEL Network: Powered by Blockchain and Masternode Technology










AXELâs goal has always been, and will continue to be, to provide ultimate data custody solutions to millions of people across the globe who will use our technology to protect and manage their personal and/or business data. To do this, we have set forth on an ambitious endeavor to build a network worthy of our reputation and the respect of our current and future users.


 


As blockchain technology has evolved alongside distributed technologies it was inevitable that their paths would cross. Blockchain provides for both secured public and private transactions and immutable record keeping with the benefits of decentralized control. Distributed networks provide faster and cheaper processing and storage of data that returns control to the data creators.


 


AXEL has combined the revolutionary power of blockchain technology with the evolutionary power of distributed and decentralized networks to create the AXEL Network. Powered by Masternode technology, the AXEL Network currently boasts hundreds of global network nodes in dozens of countries, with more being added each month.


 


This global network of Masternodes is what powers the AXEL Network. Masternodes require staking by the node operator in the form of staking AXEL Tokens.


 


The purpose of the Masternodes themselves is to contribute resources to the AXEL Network in the form of






CPU power, RAM, and storage space. AXEL Masternodes also serve as protectors of the ledger (blockchain) itself by carrying the blockchain information, writing new blocks to the chain, and maintaining the integrity and security of the blockchain network.


 


Since these Masternodes are operated by individual entities that are typically not associated with one another, itâs vital to come up with a mechanism that will establish trust between the nodes. This is where the consensus mechanism comes into play.


 


The AXEL Network utilizes a method commonly referred to as PoS or Proof-of-Stake. Unlike typical blockchain nodes, a Proof-of-Stake node (also referred to as a Masternode) requires the operator to stake a specific quantity of tokens in order to operate the node. This stake is considered collateral within the network to ensure the proper operation of each Masternode. In return for staking collateral, the Masternode host is rewarded (in the form of tokens) for supporting the network. Proof-of-Stake node holders have a vested interest in the security, integrity, and overall success of the blockchain associated with the network.


 


The AXEL Utility Token is the native Token used for services across the entire AXEL Network ecosystem and to reward the Masternode operators for supporting the AXEL Network.






















Our Points of Presence span 6 continents


























The Interplanetary File System (IPFS)








The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is an important development in computing and the next stage in the development of the Internet.


 


The IPFS protocol is designed to create a peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing digital content in a decentralized and distributed file system. Functionally, the IPFS works very much like a distributed torrent-type network where files are assigned a unique hash and then stored on network devices that are geographically close to you. Once stored, the content is available through the use of the unique hash created during storage.


 


Unlike typical HTTP-type storage platforms where all files are stored in a single server location, the IPFS distributes those files across the network, ensuring file availability even when one or more network nodes are offline.


 


To support the deployment of the IPFS System in conjunction with the AXEL blockchain, AXEL has developed a suite of enterprise class tools we call AXEL Go.  AXEL Go provides desktop and mobile applications to enable users to store, share and stream their files and digital content from any of their devices. With anywhere connectivity, AXEL Go and AXEL Network currently provide one of the worlds largest deployments of the Interplanetary File System.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES


This White Paper and associated AXEL promotional materials contain statements that constitute âforward-looking statementsâ, including but not limited to (i) the financial performance and statements relating to the anticipated financial performance of the entities that are or will be undertaking the business and financing strategies further described in this White Paper and/or any of such entitiesâ subsidiaries or affiliates, which such business and financing strategies being generally described as: The AXEL Token, blockchain, and personal data management, personal private data transmission and file transfer solutions, the AXEL Global Distributed Network (AGDN), the integration of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), the incorporation and operation of Masternodes, and planned ancillary functionalities (the âData Custody Solutionâ); and (ii) the offering of the AXEL Token in order to finance the foregoing Data Custody Solution which will facilitate the use of the AXEL Token as consumer payment for the services offered by and through such Data Custody Solution. While these forward-looking statements represent the Companyâs judgments and expectations concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties, and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from the Companyâs expectations. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which the Company is successful in executing its announced strategic plans, including the anticipated exploitation of the Data Custody Solution across various channels, markets, demographics that may be detailed in this presentation (the âChannelsâ); (ii) developments in the regulatory landscape affecting ICO financing and fundraising measures; (iii) changes in the availability of blockchain, IPFS, and Masternode technologies to assure the Data Custody Solution is exploited by and through the Channels; (iv) changes in the Data Custody Solutionâs competitive position, including whether competing companies and players will adversely affect the Companyâs ability to commercially exploit the Data Custody Solution; (v) the liability to which the Company may be exposed to claims stemming from intellectual property violations and related issues regarding third party technologies that are incorporated into the Data Custody Solution, including but not limited to blockchain, IPFS, and Masternode technologies; (vi) the Companyâs ability to retain and attract the personnel and employees necessary to design, implement, develop, and operate the Data Custody Solution and to realize revenues and to manage, support, and operate Data Custody Solution; (vii) changes in finance, crypto currency regulation, securities, accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (viii) limitations on the effectiveness of the Companyâs internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of models generally, especially as it pertains to blockchain, IPFS, and Masternode technology focused companies generally; (ix) whether the Company will be successful in keeping pace with competitors in exploiting and using blockchain, IPFS, and Masternode technologies; (x) the occurrence of operational failures, such as systems failures; and (xi) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events may have on the Data Custody Solutionâs success and the additional consequences that this may have on our business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences.


 


Furthermore, readers of our White Paper should be aware that we anticipate that our business is subject to substantial and frequently changing regulations by international, federal, state and local authorities pertaining to personal and private data and digital assets, data storage, sales of digital assets and related software providers (collectively, the âRegulationsâ). Chief among these Regulations are those that deal with the privacy of data, personal identity, personally identifiable information, and related items, as well as Regulations pertaining to the protection of intellectual properties from infringement or misappropriation. Both classes of Regulations pose significant legal challenges to businesses such as ours, which may result in unanticipated financial outlays ranging from legal compliance to litigation. Violations of these Regulations could subject us to severe fines and possible exclusion from participation in the peer-to-peer/cloud data sharing, storage, and services industry. While the Company and the Operations Company have substantial experience dealing with both classes of Regulations, and will take all reasonable steps to assure that they do not run afoul of the Regulations, including through the use and sale of the AXEL Token, compliance with the Regulations cannot be absolutely certain.


Moreover, the peer-to-peer/cloud data storage and services industry is a notoriously dynamic, trend driven, and rapidly evolving marketplace, where the prevailing Regulations can change fundamentally in ways that present new compliance challenges (e.g., in 2018, the EU enacted the General Data Protection Regulation, which is anticipated to continue to pose significant compliance challenges to a variety of operations including our own). Therefore, we will have to assure that our products and services continue to evolve and meet the demands of such dynamic and evolving Regulations. The foregoing does not purport to be a final nor exhaustive recitation of the risk factors that we anticipate our business will face which are more fully described in the accompanying AXEL Offering Memorandum.
