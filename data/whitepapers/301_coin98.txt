Coin98 Staking offers fixed interest rates based on your staking plans. There are three different packages with suitable staking periods and amounts of tokens for users to engage. 
After staking ends, users can unstake and harvest earnings directly to their wallets. Notably, stakers are unable to unstake in the first 15 days. If you unstake before the expiration date, you will only earn a fixed 2.0% floating interest rate, no matter what types of staking plans you chose.

At this moment, we are still heading down for the building. Eventually, the community will figure out a better picture for all the DeFi stacks we are nurturing.
DeFi is the century's innovation, which will undoubtedly change how global finance works in the future. Coin98 Labs is proud to be a special part of the journey of making DeFi accessible to everyone, regardless of their knowledge and familiarity with blockchain.
