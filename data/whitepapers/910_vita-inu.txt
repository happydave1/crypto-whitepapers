Introduction
Overview of Vita Inu
Summary:
 VINU is a fast and feeless memecoin with high TPS and smart contracts. It is built on the Vite network. 
Vita Inu Coin (VINU) is the governance token of the VINU ecosystem, and a token on the Vite DAG network. Created in 2021, VINU is the worldâs first fast, feeless (and cheeky) dog-themed memecoin with high TPS and smart contracts.
VINUâs philosophy is to have fun, make new friends, and learn all about the greatest technological revolution of our lifetimes â cryptocurrency â within an engaging, viral ecosystem. In conjunction with the Vite network, VINU seeks to play its part in building large DAG ecosystems where various cryptocurrencies may be moved around freely, securely, and efficiently. 
The VINU metaverse (the âVinuverseâ) is under development, and will comprise a full VR World, the VinuSwap Dapp, NFTs, staking, rewards, events, merchandise, and much more. Holders of the VINU token will be able to move seamlessly â and enjoy various benefits â within the Vinuverse. 
VINU is built on the principles of transparency and accountability. We are fully committed to working for the long-term success and sustainability of VINU. We understand that most memecoins are all bark and no bite, but we have both â offering perks that disrupt the new meme economy, such as zero fees, light-speed transactions, smart contracts, and high scalability. Through VINU, both new and seasoned cryptocurrency advocates may learn about various cryptocurrencies and how they may be bridged and connected in fun and fruitful ways.
