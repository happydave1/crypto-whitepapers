Welcome to Meter!
Meter is DeFi infrastructure with a built-in, crypto-native, metastable currency, MTR.  It uses HotStuff based PoS consensus with MTRG (Meter Governance Token) to manage the blockchain ledger.  Meter functions as a highly-decentralized, high-performance side chain for Ethereum and other public chains.
We are working to achieve three things with Meterâs DeFi infrastructure: 
Complete Bitcoinâs original vision and create a metastable sound money independent of the fiat system. 
Address performance issues that current chains are facing with our Hybrid PoW/PoS + HotStuff consensus that is backward compatible with Ethereum. 
Interconnect with other public chains like ETH and run as a side chain to enable scaling and value interaction.
Please read on to learn more!
