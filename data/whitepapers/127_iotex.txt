Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks - A Modular Infrastructure Thesis
Decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) is currently one of the hottest narratives in Web3. In this report, we present a new thesis of DePIN, namely the modular DePIN infrastructure. By retrospecting the evolution of software development platforms for building physical infrastructure networks, we describe the new technology trend of building DePIN applications on top of a community-owned modular DePIN infrastructure and highlight the characteristics of this new DePIN thesis from both technical and economic perspectives.

White Paper
IoTeX is the auto-scalable and privacy-centric blockchain infrastructure for the Internet of Things (IoT), which brings autonomous device coordination to the masses by âconnecting the physical world, block by blockâ. This paper introduces its several in-house innovations to push the frontier of blockchain 3.0, including a blockchains-in-blockchain architecture for heterogeneous computing, lightning fast Roll-DPoS consensus mechanism, and lightweight privacy-preserving techniques.

Decentralized Framework for Data Authenticity Protection in IoT Systems
This paper proposes DIoTA, a novel decentralized ledger-based authentication framework for IoT devices. DIoTA uses a two-layer decentralized ledger architecture together with a lightweight data authentication mechanism to facilitate IoT devices and data management.
We also analyze the performance and security of DIoTA, and explicitly give the major parameters an administrator can choose to achieve a desirable balance between different metrics.

Supporting Blockchain-Based Cryptocurrency Mobile Payment With Smart Devices
There is a natural demand to support cryptocurrency payments on smart devices. Considering the poor infrastructure and low penetration of financial services in developing countries, this combination has high potential impact. This paper proposed two different schemes for cryptocurrency mobile payments, one involving a centralized bank and the other not requiring any centralized party.
This paper also provides a solution to meet KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) compliance requirements in the context of cryptocurrency mobile payment processing. This work has been published in IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine.
