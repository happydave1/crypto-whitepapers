What is DIA? 
DIA is a cross-chain data and oracle platform, specializing in the sourcing and delivery of customizable data feeds both on-chain and off-chain.
DIAâs architecture focuses on transparency, customisability, and scalability. By collecting billions of raw trading data ticks directly from 80+ sources including Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), it enables full transparency customization control throughout the entire value stack, to fuel any web3 or web2 use case.
DIA aggregates an array of assets covering over 20,000 assets and can source and deliver any publicly accessible data feed, eliminating the dependency on opaque and pre-aggregated data from third parties.
DIA's data offering comprises cryptocurrency prices, NFT floor prices, fair value feeds for liquid-staked tokens, and random number generation, among others. All of DIAâs feeds can be accessed via web2 and web3 rails, including REST APIs, GraphQL, or blockchain oracles on 35+ blockchain networks.
