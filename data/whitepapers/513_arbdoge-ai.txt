Distribution Method
In the first stage of ArbDoge AI's "Call to AIDOGE" campaign, 100% of AIDOGE tokens will be distributed to the community for free. 
95% of the total amount of AIDOGE will go directly into the airdrop pool and will be claimed by users who are eligible for the ARB airdrop. (See the table below for the number of AIDOGE to be claimed)
5% of the total amount of AIDOGE will be rewarded to the inviters while stocks last.
Any unclaimed tokens will be included in future usage plans: protocol long-term development, early supporters, long-term community supporters, and burning.
Claiming Method
Users who qualify for the ARB airdrop can claim AIDOGE by logging into their wallet on the official website. It will be first come, first served. The amount of tokens to be claimed for each user will decrease in each interval based on the total token supply, as follows:
