What is Rootstock?


Rootstock's full 
technology stack
 is built on top of bitcoin:
From Rootstock smart contracts
to the Rootstock Infrastructure Framework.
The stack is designed to create a
more fair and inclusive financial system.












Bitcoin
BTC




 Is a store and transfer of value.
The blockchain is secure because miners
with high infrastructure and energy costs
create the new blocks to be added to the blockchain every 10 minutes.
The more hashing power they provide, the more secure the network is.






Rootstock
RSK


 Is the first open source smart contract platform that is
powered by the bitcoin network.
Rootstock's goal is to add value and functionality to the
bitcoin ecosystem by enabling smart-contracts,
near instant payments, and higher-scalability.










How Rootstock is connected to bitcoin?


Merged mining with Bitcoin


The first point of contact is through mining.


The bitcoin miners do what is known as

merged mining
,
securing both networks with the same infrastructure and energy consumption.


They create blocks on the bitcoin network every 10 minutes,
including transfer of bitcoin from different addresses
and in the process they create new bitcoins.


On Rootstock, blocks are created every 30 seconds,
to secure the execution of smart contracts.
This does not mint any new coins in the process,
but does earn a reward from the merged mining.


Check out 
https://rootstock.io/mine-btc-with-rootstock/

to learn more about mining.






Powpeg with Bitcoin


The second point of contact is the

Powpeg
,
also known as the bridge.


This component connects both networks to allow
the transfer of bitcoins to Rootstock,
thereby allowing developers to interact with smart contracts.
They pay gas using the same bitcoin, the smart bitcoin.


To do so, you send bitcoin to a special address,
where they are locked in the bitcoin network.
Next, in the same address over in the Rootstock network,
that same bitcoin is released to the user
for use in the Rootstock network.
This is called peg-in.


You can do the reverse operation called peg-out,
by sending your bitcoin to a special address in the Rootstock network,
and receiving your bitcoin back in the bitcoin network.
