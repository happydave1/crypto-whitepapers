Wrapped AMPL
This document expands on the details of Wrapped-AMPL. Working draft 12/8/21.
AMPL is a durable, fully-algorithmic unit of account. For more information about AMPL please see the 
Introduction to Ampleforth
 entry. 

Although 
AMPL
 is an ERC-20 token that works natively with on-chain wallets and many decentralized finance applications, the nature of automatically changing balances sometimes calls for special technical considerations.
Wrapped-AMPL is a token that wraps 
AMPL
 similar to wrapped ETH. It facilitates ecosystem integrations on both centralized and decentralized platforms. In some cases wrapped-AMPL (
WAMPL
) will be used almost invisibly in the background for bridging, routing, custody, etc. In other cases 
WAMPL
 will be a direct access point for end users who want to take a position in the 
AMPL
 network, but don't immediately need to use it as a unit-of-account.
Key Benefits
Fully Redeemable On-Chain
 â Wrapped-AMPL is fully redeemable for AMPL on-chain. A user interface for wrapping and unwrapping 
AMPL
 can be found at 
https://wrap.ampleforth.org


Zero Technical Integration
 âÂ If your platform supports ERC-20 tokens, it will support WAMPL by default without any technical considerations. 

Easy to Understand 
â
Â 
Users have come to expect that asset prices go up when thereâs more demand and down when thereâs less demand for it. 
WAMPL
 has this easy to understand property as well, which means thereâs less initial education required. Users can gradually develop an understanding of 
AMPL
 through 
WAMPL


Non Rebasing 
â 
AMPL
 automatically adjusts the quantity tokens in user wallets based on demand. This key feature allows 
AMPL
 to act as a decentralized unit of account and DeFi building-block. However, the nature of changing balances breaks traditional assumptions for matching engines, custodians, etc. Wrapped-AMPL has a simple floating price. Although 
WAMPL
 cannot be used as a unit-of-account as 
AMPL
 can, it can be held by users and network and unwrapped on-the-fly as needed. 

Fixed Supply 
â The maximum total supply of 
WAMPL
 is 10 million tokens. Holding 100,000 
WAMPL
 is equivalent to holding 1% of the 
AMPL
 network. 

Network Effects Transfer 
â Because 
AMPL
 and 
WAMPL
 are fully redeemable for one another, the growth of the Ampleforth community and demand for 
AMPL
 translates directly to demand for 
WAMPL
and vice-versa.
Overview 
Wrapped-AMPL is the output of a simple contract that allows users to deposit 
AMPL
 and receive a non-rebasing ERC-20 token and vice-versa. Since both 
WAMPL
 and 
AMPL
 are on the Ethereum platform, there are no bridges or third-party custodians that stand between redeeming one token for another. 
Contract Address 
â
Â 
 The 
WAMPL
 mainnet contract address is:

, view it on 
Etherscan
. 
Github Repo

Frequently Asked Questions
Below we capture some of the most common questions asked about Wrapped-AMPL. Please join the 
Ampleforth community Discord server
; our team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand and use 
WAMPL
.
1. Is holding WAMPL as good as holding AMPL?
Holding 
WAMPL
 provides exposure to 
AMPL
. Although 
WAMPL
 has a floating price and cannot be used as a unit-of-account, from a portfolio's perspective buying and holding 
WAMPL
 is equivalent to buying and holding 
AMPL
.
2. How many WAMPL are there?
The supply of 
WAMPL
 depends on how much of the 
AMPL
 network has been wrapped by users. The maximum total supply of 
WAMPL
 is 10 million tokensâthat is to say, if 100% of the world's 
AMPL
 were to be wrapped, the total supply of 
WAMPL
 would be 10 million. 
3. Does demand for WAMPL impact market cap growth of AMPL?
Yes. If the demand for 
WAMPL
 suddenly changes, redemption arbitrage will propagate this change in demand to 
AMPL
and vice-versa.
