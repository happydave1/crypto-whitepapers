Introduction
Whitepaper V3.4
Welcome to Illuvium, an enthralling series of fully decentralised RPG and collection games set in a fragmented world of beauty and wonder. Explore the vast landscape, hunt dangerous creatures, and capture them for battles in the Arenas or trade on the exchange. The interconnected games allow your assets to be utilised in various ways across the series.
Illuvium is built as a fully decentralised protocol and offers players a triple-A blockchain gaming experience. Stakers can vote on various aspects of the game and its tokenomics, giving them the power to shape the project's future. Additionally, they receive regular yields and distributions of the gameâs revenue.
