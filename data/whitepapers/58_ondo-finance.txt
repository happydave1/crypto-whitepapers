Distribution
â
Following a decisive vote by the DAO, the restrictions on transferring the ONDO token were lifted, enabling free movement of the token as of January 18, 2024. This pivotal decision not only unlocked the token but also established a structured distribution schedule for the ONDO token, aligning with the community's consensus.
