Token Issuance Whitepaper
This whitepaper outlines the ambitious project of Games for a Living (GFAL) and the $GFAL token offering. It provides an in-depth look at the token sale structure and pricing, outlines the team behind the project, and details the roadmap. Additionally, the whitepaper examines the use of proceeds, the regulatory environment, a risk assessment, and the legal framework. All of this is provided to ensure investors have all the necessary information to make an informed decision before investing.
IMPORTANT: 
The products described in this document may be of very high risk, including the loss of the entire amount contributed.
